# ContentShield: ephemeral (Lambda-style) runners

An API that executes nothing itself: every train it dispatches runs on a runner that is an AWS
Lambda function in production and a local Kestrel server in development.

What it proves:

- Queued mutations are POSTed to the runner's `/trax/execute` (`UseRemoteWorkers`) and return at
  once. Every synchronous run, run mutations and `[TraxQuery]` queries alike, is POSTed to
  `/trax/run` (`UseRemoteRun`) and waits for the output. No `background_job` row is written.
- Every request to the runner is signed with a key both sides share; the runner refuses anything
  unsigned with `401`.
- A train the runner finishes reaches a GraphQL subscriber on the API, over RabbitMQ.
- Anyone may submit content and look up a result; reports and violation notices need the Moderator
  role, whose only key is a demo key that exists in Development alone. The dashboard is
  Development-only.

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| `Trax.Samples.ContentShield` | The trains, the roles, the signing-key helper |
| `Trax.Samples.ContentShield.Api` | GraphQL API, dispatch (`UseRemoteWorkers` + `UseRemoteRun`), dashboard |
| `Trax.Samples.ContentShield.Runner` | A `TraxLambdaFunction`; `Program.cs` serves it locally with `RunLocalAsync` |

## Run

From `Trax.Samples/`:

```bash
docker compose up -d       # Postgres 5432, RabbitMQ 5672 (user trax / trax123)
dotnet run --project samples/EphemeralWorkers/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.Runner   # terminal 1, port 5205
dotnet run --project samples/EphemeralWorkers/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.Api      # terminal 2, port 5204
```

Both start in Development (`Properties/launchSettings.json`) and sign with a published demo key.
Anywhere else set `Trax__RunnerSigningKey` to the same `openssl rand -base64 32` value on both, or
the API refuses to start.

## Try it

```bash
# Queue a review; the runner's console logs it
curl -s http://localhost:5204/trax/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { dispatch { moderation { reviewContent(input: {contentId: \"test-002\", contentType: \"video\", contentBody: \"suspicious video content\"}) { externalId workQueueId } } } }"}'

# Run a report on the runner and wait for it (Moderator key)
curl -s http://localhost:5204/trax/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: contentshield-moderator-key-do-not-use-in-production" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { dispatch { reports { generateModerationReport(input: {reportPeriod: \"Daily\"}) { externalId output { totalReviewed totalFlagged } } } } }"}'
```

The API's `Program.cs` header holds a third example, and `DocumentedExamplesTests` runs all three.

## Tests

```bash
TRAX_TEST_PG_PORT=5432 dotnet test tests/Trax.Samples.ContentShield.E2E
```

No AWS needed: the suite serves the real `Function` through `RunLocalAsync` on a free port and
points the API at it, against `contentshield_e2e_tests`. `TRAX_TEST_RABBITMQ` overrides the broker
URI.
