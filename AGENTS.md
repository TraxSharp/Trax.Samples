# Trax.Samples

Runnable sample applications and project templates, one per deployment topology. It sits
last in the dependency order and references everything. Bookworm is the flagship.

This file is the entry point. It routes; it does not restate the rules.

## Architecture decisions

`docs/adr/` records **why** things are the way they are. A documentation page says what the
rule is; an ADR says whether it is a deliberate constraint or an accident, so you can tell
which ones are safe to change. Read the relevant one before proposing to change a rule, and
if your work contradicts one, say so rather than silently overriding it.

| Working on | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| a new sample, or an E2E factory's connection string | [0001](./docs/adr/0001-a-sample-e2e-database-must-be-one-ci-provisions.md), a factory CI does not provision reports green while testing nothing |
| a guard fixture, here or upstream | [0002](./docs/adr/0002-the-samples-adopt-the-guards-as-a-consumer-would.md), Bookworm is the only place the consumer adoption path is exercised |

Decisions binding more than one repo live in the central corpus at `Trax.Docs/adr/`, whose
index lists them by repo. Seven name `samples`. In a workspace checkout the index is at
`../Trax.Docs/adr/README.md`; that path does not resolve on GitHub, because it crosses a
repository boundary.

## When your change makes a decision

Most changes do not. When one does (reversing it would cost something real, a future reader
would ask why it is like this, and there were genuine alternatives), it takes five steps and
the build enforces four. The `adr-guard` job runs on every pull request.

| | Step | Enforced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Notice you made a decision, and write the ADR | no, this is the human step |
| 2 | Tag it `areas`, and add it to `docs/adr/README.md` | yes |
| 3 | Say where it stands in `## Status` and record it in `## Changelog` | yes |
| 4 | Give it `## Exemplars`: guards, `**Enforced elsewhere:**`, or `**Unenforced:**` with a reason | yes |
| 5 | Have each guard you named cite the ADR back, in its docstring and its failure message | yes |

Step 1 is the only one you have to remember, because no test can detect a decision you chose
not to record. The format is
[`.claude/skills/recording-decisions/ADR-FORMAT.md`](./.claude/skills/recording-decisions/ADR-FORMAT.md).

## Guards

`tests/Trax.Samples.Tests.Meta/` holds nine convention guards. Eight are shared with other
repos; `E2EDatabaseProvisioningTests` is this repo's own and reads the CI workflow to check
every sample factory against the databases CI actually creates. This repo has no
`PublicApiSurfaceTests` or `TraxPinLockstepTests`, which is correct: samples ship no public
API and no NuGet family.

`tests/Trax.Samples.Tests.Reflection/BookwormArchitectureGuards.cs` is the consumer adoption
path for the shipped guard packages, and has no test bodies by design.

The census is on: every guard class under that folder is either credited to an ADR or
carries `Not ADR-enforcing:` with a reason, and the `adr-guard` job checks it. A new guard is
unclassified until you choose, and the build says so. Opting out is a normal answer; a reason
that reads as a deferral is not.

## Running the samples and tests

```bash
docker compose up -d          # Postgres for the samples and the E2E suites
dotnet test
```
