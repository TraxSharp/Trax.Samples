> Part of [Trax](https://github.com/TraxSharp): business logic you can call, schedule, or serve as an API, with every
> run recorded in your Postgres. [Docs](https://traxsharp.net/docs) · [Getting started](https://traxsharp.net/docs/getting-started) · [All repos](https://github.com/TraxSharp)

`Trax.Samples` holds complete Trax sample apps and the `dotnet new` templates for an API, a scheduler or a hub. It sits
last in the stack and uses every other layer; the templates ship as
[Trax.Samples.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Trax.Samples.Templates), and `trax generate` in
[Trax.Cli](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Cli) builds on the hub template.

## Example

```bash
dotnet new install Trax.Samples.Templates
dotnet new trax-hub -n MyApp      # or trax-api, trax-scheduler
cd MyApp && dotnet run
```

Each template stores runs in memory, so it needs no database; swap `UseInMemory()` for `UsePostgres(...)` to keep them.

## Samples

Each sample is a working app with its own projects under `samples/`. ChatService is the most complete.

| Sample | What it shows | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| [ChatService](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/blob/main/samples/ChatService/README.md) | A chat app: mutation trains, and a lifecycle hook that publishes each result to room-scoped GraphQL subscriptions over WebSockets, with a React client | SQLite |
| [GameServer](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/LocalWorkers) | A GraphQL API (API keys and JWT) that queues work, and a scheduler whose local workers run leaderboard, rewards and match trains, with the dashboard | Postgres |
| [Bookworm](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/Bookworm) | Two domains, each with its own schema and DbContext, joined by a cross-schema GraphQL edge; also adopts the architecture-guard fixtures | Postgres |
| [GraphQLClient](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/GraphQLClient) | A gateway calling two downstream Trax servers through keyed Trax GraphQL clients, all started by one `dotnet run` | In memory |
| [EnergyHub](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/DistributedWorkers) | A hub (GraphQL, scheduler, dashboard) that runs no trains itself, and a separate worker process that claims and runs them | Postgres, RabbitMQ |
| [ContentShield](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/EphemeralWorkers) | An API that sends queued and run mutations over HTTP to a runner process standing in for a Lambda function | Postgres, RabbitMQ |
| [PersistedOperations](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/PersistedOperations) | An API that accepts only persisted operations, and a client that uploads, queries and hot-fixes them | Postgres |
| [StateMachine](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/blob/main/samples/StateMachine/README.md) | Two snapshot state machines (`turnstile`, `checkout`) served over GraphQL, with a React client driving them through the `stateMachine` mutations | Postgres |
| [SignalRDashboard](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/blob/main/samples/SignalRDashboard/README.md) | A Blazor Server page showing live train lifecycle events from the SignalR broadcaster | Postgres |
| [ApiAudit](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/blob/main/samples/ApiAudit/Trax.Samples.ApiAudit/README.md) | Every GraphQL request captured as an audit entry and written in batches to a console sink | SQLite |
| [JobHunt](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/JobHunt) | The baseline of a job-hunt CRM: GraphQL, API keys, the dashboard and domain migrations, with a React client | Postgres |
| [TestRunner](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/TestRunner) | NUnit test projects run as queued trains, with results streamed to a React client over subscriptions | Postgres |
| [DataPipeline](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples/tree/main/samples/DataPipeline) | The scheduler running three [Flowthru](https://github.com/chaoticgoodcomputing/flowthru) data pipelines as a dependency chain | Postgres |
