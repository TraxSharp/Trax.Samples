/// Marker for a scalar-only projection of an entity owned by another schema.

/// <remarks>
/// When a context reads an entity it does not own (a cross-schema read), it exposes that
/// entity through an <c>I{Entity}Reference : IEntityReference</c> interface that declares
/// only scalar columns, never navigation properties. Navigations on a cross-schema entity
/// are <see cref="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.ModelBuilder"/>-ignored in the foreign
/// context (see the <c>OnCrossSchemaModelCreating</c> convention), so a navigation declared
/// on the reference interface would compile everywhere and then throw at query time wherever
/// it is traversed. Keeping reference interfaces scalar-only makes that failure impossible.
/// Enforced by a meta-test.
